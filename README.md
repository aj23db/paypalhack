Easy-SuperMarket

Made for PayPal Hack in Shaastra 2014 at IIT-Madras.

The given prototype contains a very minimalistic and basic working model of the idea behind the Easy-SuperMarket.

Description:

index.php - User's Page.<br>
market.php - Admin/The Supermarket Page.<br>
handler.php - Handle Orders and Send to Database.<br>
db.php - Helper for connecting to database.<br>
error.php - Error Message Page.<br>

Twitter Bootstrap for UI design and CSS.

This is run on a Arch Linux using a LAMP stack.

NOTE: Since I did not have enough time to code(as I had to attend Hackfest also), there are plenty of flaws in this model. In this case, the user can also view the market page. But, the basic idea is sketched out.
